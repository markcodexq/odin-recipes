    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>   
        <li>3-4 dl coarse barley flour</li>
        <li>1 litre water</li>
        <li>2 apples and maybe a handful of hazelnuts</li>
        <li>salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Descriotion</h3>
    <p>
        Boil the water. Once the water boils, 
        whisk down the flour a little at a time. 
        Continue boiling for 5 minutes while 
        continuously stirring. 
        The apples and chopped nuts are boiled 
        the last minutes. 
        Take the pot off the fire and place it 
        close to the fire for 30 minutes to an 
        hour.
    </p>
    <p>
        A bit of honey or butter on top of 
        the porridge adds taste. 
        The apples can be replaced or 
        complemented with the fruits and 
        berries of the season.
    </p>
    <p>
        The water can partially or entirely be 
        replaced with milk, but then the porridge 
        burns more easily. If you have made butter 
        the butter milk from that can be used.
